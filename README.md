const pathToFile = Meteor.absolutePath + '/.meteor/local/build/programs/server/directory/where/is/your/file.json';
```

Returns absolute path to `.meteor` directory of your compiled application, without trailing slash.

__Note__: Be aware of the path stored in `Meteor.absolutePath`, it points to the location where Meteor application is running. It isn't guaranteed to be the same path as the path of your project. For example, running Meteor in test-mode will return a path from a temporary location where it's running.
